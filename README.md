# BlindHire
Your profile photo on Hired.com really shouldn't impact my decision to schedule
an interview. So this small Chrome Extension removes it

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select the cloned repo
4. Done!
